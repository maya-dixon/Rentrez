## Import the sequences file

```{r}
Sequences <- read.csv("./Sequences.csv")
```

## Count the number of each base pair (A, T, C and G), in each of the three sequences

```{r}
str_count(Sequences$Sequence, pattern = "A")
str_count(Sequences$Sequence, pattern = "T")
str_count(Sequences$Sequence, pattern = "G")
str_count(Sequences$Sequence, pattern = "C")
```

## Print out each sequence.

```{r}
print(Sequences$Sequence)
```

## Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences.

```{r}
tab <- matrix(c(154,155,154,114,114,115,131,131,131,82,81,81),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c("Seq 1","Seq 2","Seq 3")
rownames(tab) <- c("A","T","G","C")
tab<- as.table(tab)
print(tab)
```

Include an image of a bacteria from the internet, and a link to the Wikipedia page about Borrelia burgdorferi

## Calculate GC Content (% of nucleotides that are G or C) and create a final table showing GC content for each sequence ID,.

```{r}
GC_tab <- matrix(c("HQ433692.1", "44.28%", "HQ433694.1", "44.07%", "HQ433691.1", "44.07%"),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(GC_tab) <- c("Sequence ID","GC Content")
rownames(tab) <- c("", "1","2","3")
GC_tab<- as.table(GC_tab)
print(GC_tab)
```
